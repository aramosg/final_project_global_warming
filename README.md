## Selected topic 
The cost of weather increase and natural disasters- worldwide view
 Keywords: Earth temperature – natural disasters - cost



## Reason why they selected their topic 

Out of the norm hot days have been the headers of news in multiple countries. It is not only in those places were notorious, now longer, hot summers are common, but lately hot days for countries that hardly lived through a hot environment have been the talk in news and media in multiple countries. Weather seems to behave lately in an erratic and new way that we are yet to understand, compared to what was catalogued as the normal temperature behaviour in the different parts of the world in the past.

Just as with the develop of new technologies, that let us survive nature in extreme situations and natural dissasters, this worldwide temperature alteration, affect in multiple ways (rural, suburban, urban/ habitats/ places) and living beings are now pushed to adapt to these new changes to try to withstand new temperatures within their land. 

In human habitats, there’s a variety of aspects that each individual need to take into consideration with this new weather behaviour to fulfil their daily life routine, it ranges from mild modifications like clothing, liquids consumption or technologies like aircon, fans or other measures to counter the heat, to more drastic situations that could even endanger health with disease outsprings, like in the case of direct temperature affectation in heat stroke in risk population like elderly and kids, leading to morbidity and mortality. This has been a special worry when the infrastructure or technologies are scarce or lost due to accidental factors, like natural disasters or low resources, even in first world countries. 

Humans are not the only affected by temperature, surroundings and animals’ cattle and other living beings are affected by the temperature, important for human survival. It could have from positive to negative range of outcomes. Longer hot summer days with other optimal conditions, have been reported to overgrow vegetables   for example or other crops triggered by this longer warm environment. There’s also the other side of the coin were these extreme temperatures leaning in levels of natural disasters, were crops are lost over extreme unusual temperatures affecting a huge population and economy sectors.  

Natural disasters implications (**pending**)


- Objective 
We wanted to analyse and understand the temperature modifications that have been taking place and contrast it with natural disasters reported within a year, to objectively analyse if there’s a correlation as well as to see if there has been a statistically significant and the evolution from previous years.

The impact of this findings are then associated with economical variables like (**pending**) 

Our objective was to analyse weather temperature from 1970 to 2020 worldwide as well as reports of natural disasters and economical metric implications to try to understand the impact of this recent crisis. 
This data could have an impact and benefit different sectors including, economy, and industries, health. 
One sector we would like to make an example for the use of our following analysis is the agricultural sector. As described before there are reports how weather and temperatures have a huge impact in crops and grains development. A big list of food and beverages industries need to know and understand temperature differences when investing and the develop of their products.

Questions they hope to answer with the data
Is there a correlation of temperature increase world wide and the number of natural disasters?
What is the impact of this variables in sectors like economy?

We want to offer a machine learning model able to describe the role of this variables and the impact it has in (variable economica).
